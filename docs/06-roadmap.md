# 06 · Roadmap

Phased so that **each phase ships something demoable and resume-worthy on its own.**
Don't wait for the AI to have a working product — the deterministic engine is the
foundation and is impressive by itself.

---

## Phase 0 — Spike & decide _(a weekend)_ ✅ **COMPLETE**
Prove the risky part early. **Language decided: Python** (see [`04-technical-depth.md`](./04-technical-depth.md) §7).
- [x] Parallel scanner (`os.scandir` + thread pool, `Queue.join()` termination); measured vs `du`: **~1.57× faster** on 290K files (see [`08-benchmarks-and-results.md`](./08-benchmarks-and-results.md)).
- [x] Byte-accounting confirmed on real machine: **0-byte difference from `du`** over 290K files; hard-link dedup validated with a controlled test (shared inode counted once).
- [x] Module boundaries established (`platform / core.scanner / core.rules / core.model / cli`) so the hot path stays swappable later.
- **Exit criteria:** ✅ scans the home/projects dir fast and prints total reclaimable bytes.

## Phase 1 — The engine (MVP) _(the core project)_ ✅ **COMPLETE**
This alone is a legitimate, strong portfolio project. Shipped in three demoable
milestones: **1a** classification intelligence (read-only), **1b** reversible removal core
(journal + quarantine + safety gate), **1c** the CLI reclaim loop (planner + apply/undo).

- [x] Concurrent scanner with pruning + correct sizing. _(Phase 0)_
- [x] Three-tier rule-based classifier for the common artifacts. _(1a — safety lattice)_
- [x] Project analyzer: root detection, type, **git-state**, activity. _(1a — defensive git,
  mtime dormancy)_
- [x] `reclaim scan` / `reclaim status` with a clean grouped report. _(1a — tiered report +
  per-project fact sheets)_
- [x] Quarantine store + write-ahead journal + `reclaim apply` / `reclaim undo`. _(1b engine +
  1c CLI — atomic apply, crash recovery, cross-FS copy-verify-delete, TOCTOU re-check.)_
- [x] Planner (goal → ranked plan) + `plan`/`apply`/`undo`/`ls`/`purge` CLI. _(1c — greedy by
  safety-then-size, dry-run + confirm, `$RECLAIM_HOME` store, startup recovery.)_
- [x] Tests for the safety invariants. _(1a + 1b + 1c — git-WIP hard-protect, unknown⇒🔴,
  protect-paths win, **undo restores byte-identical**, crash rolls back, never clobbers,
  TOCTOU rejects newly-dirty — **70 tests green**.)_
- **Exit criteria:** ✅ a stranger can safely reclaim space with it, no AI involved.

> **1a (done):** `reclaim status` classifies a real 290K-file tree in ~3.4 s into 🟢/🟡/🔴
> with git-state and dormancy per project; nothing is ever removed (read-only).
>
> **1b (done):** reversible removal core — never `rm` (move to quarantine), write-ahead
> journal with startup crash-recovery, atomic all-or-nothing transactions, and a Safety Gate
> that re-checks git at apply time.
>
> **1c (done):** the CLI reclaim loop — `reclaim plan/apply/undo/ls/purge`. Planner selects
> greedily by (safety, then size); apply is dry-run + confirm by default and fully undoable.
> End-to-end scan→plan→gate→apply→undo verified byte-identical.

## Phase 2 — The AI agent _(the differentiator)_
- [ ] `reclaim chat` with grounded tool-calling (Claude API).
- [ ] Read-only fact tools + `propose_plan` routed through the Safety Gate.
- [ ] Natural-language goals → plans; "why is this safe?" explanations.
- [ ] Preference memory (`never touch ~/work/**`).
- **Exit criteria:** the demo paragraph in [`01-vision.md`](./01-vision.md) actually works.

## Phase 3 — The ambient product _(polish & wow)_
- [ ] Background daemon: watch disk growth, warn before the wall.
- [ ] Trends ("Docker grew 12 GB this month").
- [ ] TUI dashboard.
- [ ] User config file for custom rules/protections.
- [ ] `brew install` / one-line installer, real README, demo GIF.

---

## Resume / portfolio checklist (do these alongside the build)
- [ ] A README with a **demo GIF** and a **benchmark number** ("X GB scanned in Ys, Z× faster than `du`").
- [ ] An **ARCHITECTURE.md** (lift from [`04-technical-depth.md`](./04-technical-depth.md)) — signals you design before you code.
- [ ] Tests that encode the **safety invariants** — reviewers love "this test proves it can never delete uncommitted work."
- [ ] One blog post / writeup on *"how I made file deletion reversible and crash-safe"* — this is the piece that gets shared.
- [ ] Resume bullet framing (draft):
  > Built **Reclaim**, an AI-guided disk-reclamation engine (Python): an I/O-parallel
  > filesystem scanner (comparable to `du`, via `os.scandir` + a thread pool), a
  > fail-safe 3-tier classifier, and crash-safe reversible deletes via a write-ahead
  > journal + quarantine, with a grounded LLM agent that plans and explains cleanups but
  > is architecturally incapable of unsafe actions. Modular engine with a portability
  > boundary for future hot-path rewrite (PyO3).

## Sequencing principle
> Build **depth-first on safety and speed**, not breadth-first on features.
> One rock-solid, fast, reversible reclaim of `node_modules` beats ten shaky cleaners.
